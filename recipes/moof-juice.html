    <h1>Moof Juice</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's something amusing about the thought of roaming around Disney's Star Wars Galaxy's Edge with a Moof Juice in hand. Maybe it's because it's hard to say the word "moof" without smirking. Maybe it's because Wookieepedia says a Moof is a hoofed creature in the Star Wars galaxy that can be milked. No, not blue milk (that accolade goes to the female bantha).</p>
    <p>Moof Juice, like its Batuubucha Tea and Phattro companions, is a non-alcoholic beverage served at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo. As per the menu, Moof Juice consists of Simply Orange with Pineapple juice, Simply Fruit Punch, and chipotle pineapple. As if to echo Batuu's salutation BRIGHT SUNS, this drink lights up in a brilliant shade of cantaloupe orange.</p>
    <p>Simply Orange with Pineapple juice and Simply Fruit Punch are fairly easy to track down at your local grocery store. The one element that may be a bit harder to procure is the chipotle pineapple flavoring. We think this is a bottled syrup from Monin, a flavored syrup company with US headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. You can buy Monin Chipotle Pineapple syrup on Amazon here.</p>
