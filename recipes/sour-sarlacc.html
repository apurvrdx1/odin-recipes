    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We are sad to see the Sour Sarlacc drink disappear from Disney World's Galaxy’s Edge drink lineup, so we made a Sour Sarlacc copycat recipe to enjoy the taste back home!</p>
    <p>We had our first Sour Sarlacc bright and early at Ronto Roasters accompanied by a breakfast Ronto Wrap. It is a tasty, tart drink that woke up our taste buds and was just what we needed for the 5:00am wake-up call required to take part in Hollywood Studios’ Extra Extra Magic Hours!</p>
    <p>Later, we learned that the tartness of the Sour Sarlacc comes from Minute Maid limeade and it gets its distinct color from the addition of Monin’s Raspberry syrup.  But, the showstopper here is Monin’s Spicy Mango syrup that gives it both a tropical flavor and a spicy kick. Monin brand syrups can be found on Amazon: Raspberry here / Spicy Mango here.</p>
    <p>If the name “sarlacc” sounds familiar, this desert-dwelling creature makes an appearance in the Star Wars Return of the Jedi. The sarlacc is responsible for Boba Fett’s defeat, as he falls into the creature's mouth. As far as we know, we aren’t supposed to believe we’re drinking a component of a sarlacc here (as we suspect is the case with Moof Juice). Like a “Mule” cocktail, we think the "Sarlacc" name simply means that this drink packs a punch.</p>
    <p>The Sour Sarlacc we had at breakfast was so tasty that, later that day, we went back for another one, this time at Docking Bay 7. Oddly enough, the drink no longer tasted as tart as it did earlier that morning at Ronto Roasters. It tasted a lot more spicy! We accounted for this in our recipe below. You can choose to add more or less Spicy Mango syrup depending on how spicy or tart you like your drink.</p>
