    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Jedi Mind Trick copycat is the recipe you’re looking for, no mind trick required! We first tasted this delicious drink at Oga’s Cantina in Disney World’s Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. Its description on the menu read as below and, as fans of vodka cocktails, we ordered one up!</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, we found the taste of the drink similar to Disney World’s signature Blue Glow-tini cocktail, but with a grapefruit, not pineapple, flair. Having an affinity for grapefruit since indulging in grapefruit cake at the Hollywood Brown Derby (which, coincidentally, is a short walk from Oga’s), this flavor was fine by us!</p>
    <p>After tasting Galaxy’s Edge drinks like Moof Juice, T-16 Skyhopper, and a Sour Sarlacc, we don't think there’s anything particularly other-worldly about the taste of the Jedi Mind Trick. That said, it packs a punch alcohol-wise and its appearance is impressive. The drink, with its blue-green color and sparking ice cubes, appears to glow like a lightsaber. And not just any lightsaber, but a good-guy, Jedi lightsaber. There’s no glow cube required here!</p>
    <p>As we made this drink, we noticed that the brands of the ingredients are important. For example, we used another brand of white grape juice than what’s recommended below and it made the whole drink taste terrible. That said, if you decide to swap out the flavored vodka for an unflavored one that you might already have on hand, it should still taste good and have the same vibrant drink color.</p>
