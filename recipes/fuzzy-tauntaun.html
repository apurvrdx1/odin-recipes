    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The most buzz-worthy drink recipe at Galaxy's Edge's Oga's Cantina is the Fuzzy Tauntaun with Buzz Button Tingling Foam! This one took a lot of experimenting, but we are so happy with the final results, and it's actually pretty easy, too.</p>
    <p>Oga's spin on a Fuzzy Navel cocktail, this beverage is a peachy, alcoholic orange juice. The liquid part of this drink is simple and tasty, but the large pile of bubbly foam is what makes this a shocking addition to the Oga's Cantina menu!</p>
    <p>This is Buzz Button Tingling Foam and it creates a sensation of overall heat (spiciness), some tingling, and, lastly, a slight numbing effect. Some, like us, enjoy this sensation. Others will be asking a Cast Member for a straw so they can avoid the foam altogether while still enjoying the beverage.</p>
    <p>The foam's tingling and numbing sensation is courtesy of a tiny, Szechuan flower called the buzz button (acmella oleracea). Now this isn't something you can find in the produce section of your local grocery store, so we had to order these little flowers on Amazon from Natural Nomad Farms, a boutique farm located in Florida.</p>
    <p>If you are unable to get fresh buzz buttons, and are willing to wait, many readers have had success with planting their own seeds to grow buzz buttons! This is a great and very inexpensive way to go!</p>
    <p>Not new to the world of cocktails, the buzz button is more commonly used as a garnish to be consumed whole. But, here, we needed to find a way to infuse them into the foam. We decided to create what's called a "buzz button tincture," which uses alcohol to extract the part of the buzz button that creates the numbing effect. Usually, a tincture is created slowly over 4 weeks, but the one we made was strong enough after 3 to 4 days.</p>
    <p>The hard part was creating a stable air form. We read up on the complex world of molecular gastronomy and decided to try soy lecithin, but it wouldn't stabilize. We tried gelatin, but it thickened too quickly and tasted terrible. The best luck we had at creating a bubbly, stable foam was also the easiest! We used a common ingredient in royal icing, Wilton's meringue powder, to create a tasty foam!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   <h2>The 'Buzz Foam'</h2>
   <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The information below on how we made a foam is intended to be an account of how we created it only. It is not intended as a recipe for others to use, as it has not been evaluated for safety. Should you choose to make this yourself, please do so at your own risk. We do not assume any liability of others for adverse affects of buzz button consumption.</p>
   <p>For those curious on how we made a buzz button foam in addition to the Fuzzy Tauntaun copycat recipe: We ordered 60, fresh Buzz Buttons on Amazon from Natural Nomad Farms, a boutique farm located in Florida. Upon arrival, we put the buttons in a large mason jar, added about 1/2 cup of Tito's (80 proof) vodka, covered it with the lid, and popped it in the fridge. After 3 to 4 days, we noticed that there was enough "buzz sensation" to proceed with the foam. We refer to this buzz button infused vodka as "buzz button tincture."</p>
   <p>To make the buzz foam, we added 1.5 cups of cold water to an 8" x 8" square, glass baking dish. Then, while whisking constantly, we added 1/4 cup of the buzz button tincture (strained), 2 teaspoons of Wilton meringue powder and 1/2 teaspoon Xanthan gum for stability. Disney isn't using meringue powder, but we went with something easy and accessible to us. The taste is sweeter than Oga's (meringue powder is used for royal icing) and the texture is pasty. But, the buzz sensation is strong, and the foam is stable.</p>
   <p>Next, we put an electric hand mixer into the water on low to medium speed. Holding the mixer in one place (the mixer clanged on the bottom of the glass pan), it created a current where bubbles collected to make foam.Once we had enough bubbles collected, we immediately and gently scooped off the foam and added it to the top of our cocktail. When scooping the large bubbles onto the cocktail, they dissipated into a smaller, bubble-bath type foam resembling the one at Oga's.</p>
