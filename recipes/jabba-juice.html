    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You needn't place a bounty on the head of your favorite Oga's Cantina chemist because we have the copycat recipe for Jabba Juice! Arguably the best non-alcoholic beverage at the Cantina, we might go one step further and say this is the best one in Galaxy's Edge.</p>
    <p>Yet, there's a story behind this drink. At Oga's Cantina, lives a creature called a Worrt, whose eggs are harvested for the Jabba Juice. Upon closer look, one can see these eggs are the blueberry popping pearls that sit atop the Jabba Juice. Now that's the kind of storytelling we love to see!</p>
    <p>On our trip to Oga's Cantina, our Jabba Juice was missing these blueberry Worrt eggs. In its place were green apple popping pearls which are found, along with blueberry pearls, on another Oga's non-alcoholic beverage called the Carbon Freeze. It turned out to be a happy mistake because green apple popping pearls are delicious! Even better, they feel more "Jabba the Hutt-esque" thanks to their slimy, green nature.</p>
    <p>The overall hue of this drink is orange, but there is a faint murky green tinge thanks to Monin Kiwi Syrup. Even though the beverage is mostly pineapple orange juice, any orange juice taste is masked by the sweet cantaloupe and kiwi syrups. So if the thought of drinking a large glass of OJ is not your cup of tea, this drink still might be up your alley. Add in a healthy dose of popping pearls, and this drink is pretty rad!</p>
