# odin-recipes
Course-based project via The Odin Project to build a simple recipes website using HTML only.

My take on the project is to create a list of Star Wars themed cocktails that I would 
collect from around the world wide web. I found a few on DIZNIFY (https://www.diznify.com/) 
and would start there. eventually adding more from other places. 

For this first pass, all the images and recipes are intellectual property of diznify and I 
would add a link to the original page on each recipe.
